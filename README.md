# Dyego-w

Dyego-w is a prototype of the Dyego language written in TypeScript that produces
WASM output.

Diego-w is intended to be a low-level langauge that is a direct surface of WASM
as a semi-usable lanuage similar to C in character but not syntax. This will form
a low-level AST that higher levels of Dyego.
